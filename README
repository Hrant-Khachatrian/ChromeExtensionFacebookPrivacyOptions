A Google Chrome extension that changes the names of privacy options in Facebook to reflect the leaked information by Edward Snowden :) See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) for details

Inspired by an image seen on the web.

Available on Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/egogfffhneiihhcpbeccdmejmlleoihg/

Can be extended to support multiple locales, privacy options in other parts of Facebook etc.
